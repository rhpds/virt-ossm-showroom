# Module 3: Enhancing Networking with OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM)

# (REMOVE) Prerequisites - Technical Steps 

* Deploy OpenShift Service Mesh
* Install the OSSM operator
* Configure an Istio control plane
* Connect VMs to the Service Mesh **WARNING** this cannot be predone because it give a network issue where VM pods cannot connect to each other due to sidecar. **HOW WILL WE TRIGGER THIS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ALL VMS?**


# (REMOVE) Hands-On - Technical Steps

## Task 1: Explore what the OpenShift Service Mesh world is and what it offers

. Go to istio-system and have a look at the SMCP
. The SM Components wha are they, what do they offer, how do I find them?
. Login to Kiali and watch nothing
. Login to Jaeger and watch nothing

Task 1: 

## Task 2: Enable your VM to be part of the mesh and connect to cloud native components

. Add the 3 namespaces to the Mesh - SMMR (**NOTE:** maybe this script updates all other VMs/containers with the sidecar annotation and restarts them)


. Add the VM to a service mesh project

* Add the applications to the Mesh - istio injection
* Restart the apps - 

. Validate everything in the observability stack

* Kiali - mtls, graph, traffic distribution, 
* Tracing console
* Istio metrics captured in OCP observability stack
* Grafana

**Bonus Point: ** Why is the travel-dashboard not accessible? Maybe as fun point we get 10 t-shirts and in each module we get them to **think** and first 10 ppl that answer the questions correctly get the t-shirts. Can we get budget or from OCP Virt / Mesh BUs to provide the t-shirts?
