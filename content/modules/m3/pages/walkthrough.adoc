# Module 3: Enhancing Networking with OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM)

# (REMOVE) Prerequisites - Technical Steps 

* Deploy OpenShift Service Mesh
* Install the OSSM operator
* Configure an Istio control plane
* Connect VMs to the Service Mesh **WARNING** this cannot be predone because it give a network issue where VM pods cannot connect to each other due to sidecar. **HOW WILL WE TRIGGER THIS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ALL VMS?**


# (REMOVE) Hands-On - Technical Steps

Moving Virtual Machines into OpenShift enabled you to expose and scale the applications running within through the configuration of a `Service` controller resulting in a loadbalancer called that routes the traffic to all instances of the Virtual Machines. However, the ease with which this is possible results in added complexity when creating appropriate ring-fencing around access rights to a Virtual Machine, level of throughput, monitoring of the traffic load it receives, releasing new versions of it and providing resillience.

OpenShift comes with Service Mesh which is an add-on service layer which assist in solving 4 main use cases in the Cloud Native world:

. Security
. Traffic Management
. Observability
. Resilliene & Error Handling

The administrators have already done the setup of Service Mesh so lets see how easy it is to enable a a Virtual Machine to take advantage of these new capabilities.

## Task 1: Explore what the OpenShift Service Mesh world is and what it offers

Firstly, lets explore a few of the components of Service Mesh as it will offer clarity on the results of the activities you will undertake in the follow-up sections.

image::02-OSSM-Components.png[]

OpenShift Service Mesh is delivered as part of the platform through an operator which is a specialised program to deliver the mesh runtime components. These include:

* *istiod*: a component that will apply all your defined policies (security, traffic management etc.) in the network of Virtual Machines and containers included in the mesh.
* *envoy*: a component that enhances your Virtual Machines with the ability to read and apply the policies and effectively makes your Virtual Machine part of the mesh. The envoy sits next to your Virtual Machine (see the image above) and intercepts all requests coming in and out of it.
* *Kiali*: an observability component which visualises what is configured in the mesh, the network of included applications, the traffic throughut/latency, the security utilised and a host of other visualisation capabilities.
* The rest of the observbility components (as seen in the image above) contain parts of what _kiali_ visualises eg. metrics, traces etc.
* *Gatewas*: one or more ingress gateway components are made available to allow traffic flowing into mesh included services from the outside as the mesh comes with network policies that disable direct access to them and an egress gateway respectively can allow outgoing traffic from the mesh to external services.


## Task 2: Access the Observability Stack

Remember one of the capabilities the service mesh adds is to enhance OpenShift and deployed components observability without the need for the applications within the Virtual Machines to be altered. 

Lets find the URLs of the observability components by executing the following commands in your terminal.

NOTE: The service mesh components have been installed by the platform team in the `istio-system` namespace.

[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
echo "http://$(oc get route kiali -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n istio-system)"
echo "https://$(oc get route jaeger -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n istio-system)"
echo "https://$(oc get route prometheus -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n istio-system)"
echo "https://$(oc get route grafana -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n istio-system)"

----

. Login to the `Jaeger` dashboard to check the traffic traces for the _Travel Agency_ solution:
+
* Follow the link to the Jaeger URL (login with `OpenShift`` (username/password) and in the `Authorize Access` page select `Allow selected permissions`).
* In the Jaeger dashboard you should be able see traces of the traffic flowing between any components that are part of the mesh. In the `Service` drop down list you can select the service that traffic is originating from and in the `Operation` drop down *WHAT*?
* Currently, you should see there are no services listed. *Can you figure out based on the information provided in Task 1 why that is?*
+
image::03-t2-jaeger-empty.png[]
* Leave the 'Jaeger' dahsboard in your browser and proceed to the next task.

. Login to the `Grafana` dashboard and to view via the precreated Istio Grafana dashboards service, traffic volume for the _Travel Agency_ solution:
* Follow the link to the `Grafana` URL (login with `OpenShift`` (username/password) and in the `Authorize Access` page select `Allow selected permissions`).
* From the left of the menu follow *Dashboards* → *Browse* → *Istio* → *Istio Mesh Dashboard* to access the Grafana dashboard that should show the services in the mesh and the traffic volume as well as HTTP codes of sucess failure of the requests.
* Currently, you should see there are no services listed or traffic flowing. *You must be suspecting something is not quite right by now*
+
image::04-t2-grafana-empty.png[]
* Leave the 'Grafana' dahsboard in your browser and proceed to the next task.


. Login to `Kiali` to view a visualisation of the _Travel Agency_ solution in the mesh:
* Follow the link to the `Kiali` URL, login with username/password and 
* Fom the left hand side menu select _Graph_ and from the _Namespace_ drop-down menu (top) choose the `Select All` option.
* Notice, again there is no Graph visualisation of any service _Travel Agency_ solution:

* Leave the 'Kiali' dahsboard in your browser and proceed to the next task.

IMPORTANT: Why can I not see my services?


## Task 3: Add the _Travel Agency_ Virtual Machines & Containers to the mesh

If it was not apparent until now, service mesh is capable to only apply policies (security, observability etc.) only to those deployed components that are part of the mesh. In order to enable this the following 2 actions are required and neither requires a change in the original software.

. Add the 3 namespaces of _Travel Agency_ to the Mesh - SMMR (**NOTE:** maybe this script updates all other VMs/containers with the sidecar annotation and restarts them).
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
oc apply -f 1-servicemeshmember.yaml
----

. Add the an `envoy` sidecar (namely the `istio-proxy` container) to a service mesh project.
* The following actions inserts the annotation `sidecar.istio.io/inject` to the `POD` of each component and restarts the POD so that the mesh action of inject the `istio-proxy` container and start applying the policies takes effect.
[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
ACTION TO BE DEFINED
./2-add-travel-portal-to-mesh.sh
./3-deploy-travel-portal-domain.sh
./4-deploy-travel-services-domain.sh
----


## Task 4: Validate that the _Travel Agency_ Virtual Machines are part of the mesh

Lets validate now that the actions taken has successfully placed the _Travel Agency_ components (Virtual Machines and containers) in the mesh and you have started to take advantage of the added on offered capabilities so that the VMs can be elevated with cloud native capabilities.

. Back in the `Kiali` screen, in the _Namespace_ drop-down menu (top) choose the `Select All` option (you should now have 4 namespaces that include the 3 _Travel Agency_ namespaces we added to the mesh) amd in the _3rd_ drop-down menu (top) make sure  the `Versioned App Graph` option is selected. Now you should see the whole network of microservices (VMs and containers) making up the solution (the VMs in `travel-agency`,  `travel-control` namespaces side-by-side with the container based deployments in `travel-portal`).
+

+
Perform the following actions in order to understand how OpenShift Service Mesh has already added functionality to the solution without having to perform any re-implementation of the VMs.
+


. Awesome job! Lets now validate everything in the _Travel Agency_ using the observability tools you have already seen.


* In `Kiali` you can follow the guidance below, revealing the traffic secured with certificates as well as review the throughput, rate and distribution of the traffic into your VMs.
+
image::07-t2-kiali-graph-validation.gif[]

* The solution has been enhanced with metrics so that you can use to check the _throughput size_ and _latency_ in/out of the Virtual Machine as well as success or failure error codes. Follow the review on the _travels-vm_ of the guide below in your own `Kiali` UI showing you the inbound/outbound traffic metrics.
+
image::08-t2-kiali-metrics.gif[]

* The Virtual Machines did not get altered but you are already getting a whole new experience. Look in the `Jaeger` Tracing console (per the following guide) which now contains traces of 
** the traffic in/out of the Virtual Machines 
** showing both successful and failed traced requests
** the services the request traverses, 
** the time it takes in each step 
** whether the request was a success or a failure. 
+
image::09-t2-jaeger-tracing.gif[]
+


* Finally, the Grafana dashboards (_Istio Mesh Dashboard_) have been populated with information about the solution that you can use to undertand the healthiness, content and usage of the solution.
+

+


. Testing the service

* Using the Travel Agency UI URL Fails https://travel-dashboard-travel-control.apps.cluster-szndb.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io/ fails. 
** **Bonus Points: ** Why is the travel-dashboard not accessible? Maybe as fun point we get 10 t-shirts and in each module we get them to **think** and first 10 ppl that answer the questions correctly get the t-shirts. Can we get budget or from OCP Virt / Mesh BUs to provide the t-shirts?
* Lets execute a request for Travel in a manual manner
** Lets check for a flight to London

NOTE: As you use the tooling consider the new abilities and features they have presented you with whilst you did not have to change the original VM configuration.
