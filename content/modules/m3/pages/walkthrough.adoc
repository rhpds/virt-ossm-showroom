# Module 3: Integrating and Observing Virtual Machines in OpenShift Service Mesh

NOTE: All assets for this module are in the folder `lab-3`. Please change the directory into this folder.

[,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cd $HOME/virt-ossm-workspace/lab-3
----

## Task 1: Explore the Service Mesh Observability Stack

Firstly, find the URLs of the service mesh observability components by executing the following commands in your terminal.

[,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo "http://$(oc get route kiali -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n istio-system)"
echo "https://$(oc get route jaeger -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n istio-system)"
echo "https://$(oc get route grafana -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n istio-system)"
----

NOTE: The Service Mesh components have been installed by the platform team in the `istio-system` namespace, therefore you can you can also find the observability URLs in the namespace `istio-system` at *Networking -> Routes* menu of the OpenShift console.

### 1. Jaeger Tracing

Jaeger is an open-source **distributed tracing** system designed to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in **microservices architectures**. It helps track requests as they flow through services, providing insights into **latency, dependencies, and bottlenecks**. Jaeger is widely used for **performance optimization, root cause analysis, and observability** in cloud-native applications.

The `Jaeger` dashboard offers the capability to inspect traces of the traffic exchanged within the _Travel Booking_ application.

====
Login to the dashboard at the `Jaeger` URL by using your credentials *{openshift_cluster_admin_username}/{openshift_cluster_admin_password}*.

At the `Authorize Access` page select `Allow selected permissions`. 

image::02-jaeger-login.gif[link=self, window=blank]
====

The `Jaeger` console shows traces of the traffic flowing between services that are already part of the mesh.

====
You can select from the `Service` drop down list the service you wish to inspect traces originating from.

image::03-t2-jaeger-empty.png[link=self, window=blank]
====

[NOTE]
====
Currently, you don't see any services listed. That is correct!

<details>
  <summary style="color:red;"><b>Challenge Yourself with this Question</b></summary>
  <p style="color:black;"><strong>Can you figure out based on the information provided in the introduction section why that is the case?</strong></p>
</details>
++++
====

Leave the `Jaeger` dahsboard open in your browser as we will come back to it a little bit later and lets explore the next observability tool.

### 2. Grafana Dashboard

====
Access the `Grafana` dashboard by following the link to the `Grafana` URL with your credentials *{openshift_cluster_admin_username}/{openshift_cluster_admin_password}*.
====

====
In the Dashboard go to *Dashboards → Browse → Istio → Istio Mesh Dashboard* to access the `Grafana` dashboard that shows all the services in the mesh, the traffic volume they receive as well as HTTP codes of success or failure of the requests.

image::04-t2-grafana-empty.png[link=self, window=blank]
====

NOTE: Again there there are no services listed or traffic flowing. *You must be suspecting something is not quite right by now. Can you point your finger at the problem?*

====
There are additional dashboards under *Dashboards → Browse → Istio* to help you monitoring the dataplane (Virtual Machines, containers) as well as the controlplane (the istio components) of the service mesh.
====

Leave the `Grafana` dahsboard open in your browser as we will come back to it a little later and lets explore `Kiali`.

### 3. Kiali Dashboard

====
Access `Kiali` to explore a visualisation of the _Travel Booking_ application in the mesh. 
Login by using your credentials *{openshift_cluster_admin_username}/{openshift_cluster_admin_password}*. 
====

====
Once logged in, at the left hand side menu select *`Graph`* and choose the *`Select All`* option of the _Namespace_ drop-down menu (at the top).

image::05-t2-kiali-empty.png[link=self, window=blank]
====

NOTE: Again there is no Graph visualisation of any service _Travel Booking_ application.

Leave the `Kiali` dahsboard in your browser and proceed to the next task.

CAUTION: Why can't you see any services?

*Despite the lack of data you have been successfull!* You have now successfully accessed and explored the additional observability tools provided by OpenShift Service Mesh.  

## Task 2: Add the _Travel Booking_ Virtual Machines & Containers to OpenShift Service Mesh

If it was not apparent until now, you can only apply policies (security, observability etc.) to Virtual Machines and containers that are part of the mesh!

IMPORTANT: In order to become part of the mesh each _Travel Booking_ namespace must be configured to be a *member of the mesh*, and each workload component needs to have an *additional _sidecar container_ injected*, which will intercept the traffic to/from your Virtual Machine. 

Right now though, the Virtual Machines pods have a *single container!*

image::06-t2-ossm-travel-agency-1-container.png[link=self, window=blank]
image::06-t2-ossm-travel-control-1-container.png[link=self, window=blank]

Lets add the _Travel Booking_ application to the service mesh. 

First we create a `ServiceMeshMember` resource for each of the 3 namespaces of the _Travel Booking_ application, which will include them to the mesh. (See the details at {virt_ossm_workspace_repo}/{virt_ossm_workspace_project}/blob/main/lab-3/servicemeshmember.yaml[servicemeshmember.yaml, window=_blank])

[,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f servicemeshmember.yaml
----

Now we add the sidecar container to each of the workloads (VMs and containers).
This forms the actual dataplane of the mesh, and consists of an `envoy-proxy` (namely the `istio-proxy` container).

The provided scripts will insert the injection annotation `sidecar.istio.io/inject` in each workload and also restart them, so that service mesh can inject the `istio-proxy` container and start applying the configured policies.

Execute in the *Terminal* the following scripts:

[,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
./add-envoy-to-travel-agency-services-domain.sh
----

[,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
./add-envoy-to-travel-portal-domain.sh
----

[,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
./add-envoy-to-travel-control.sh
----

NOTE: For details of how this is done see the scripts at {virt_ossm_workspace_repo}/{virt_ossm_workspace_project}/blob/main/lab-3/add-envoy-to-travel-agency-services-domain.sh[add-envoy-to-travel-agency-services-domain.sh, window=_blank], {virt_ossm_workspace_repo}/{virt_ossm_workspace_project}/blob/main/lab-3/add-envoy-to-travel-portal-domain.sh[add-envoy-to-travel-portal-domain.sh, window=_blank], {virt_ossm_workspace_repo}/{virt_ossm_workspace_project}/blob/main/lab-3/add-envoy-to-travel-control.sh[add-envoy-to-travel-control.sh, window=_blank]. 

Now we have included all _Travel Booking_ VMs and Containers in the mesh, and each POD is made up of 2 containers (the `workload` and the `istio-proxy` container)

image::06-2-containers.gif[link=self, window=blank]

*This is it!!* The Virtual Machines can now take advantage of all the service mesh features.

## Task 3: Validate that the _Travel Booking_ application is part of the mesh

### 1. Kiali Dashboard 
Go back to the `Kiali` Dashboard. 

We are now able to visualise network information about the _Travel Booking_ services. 

TIP: `Kiali` can give you a lot more than just visualisation of the network. You can review the applied mesh configurations, modify them or apply new ones.

====
In the `Kiali` Dashboard, click the *Select All* option, from the *Select Namespace* drop-down menu (at the top). You should now see 3 _Travel Booking_ namespaces listed. 
====

====
The `Versioned App Graph` shows the whole network of microservices (VMs and containers) and the traffic flowing between them.

image::06-t2-ossm-travel-agency.gif[link=self, window=blank]
====

IMPORTANT: Wow this is truly brilliant. Containers and VMs working side by side within the platform and the mesh is integrating them without distinguishing on the technology of their runtime. You only had to make 1 annotation change to the Virtual Machine resource.

NOTE: You can explore additional features of Kiali in the optional Task 5.

### 2. Jaeger Tracing

Go back to the `Jaeger` Tracing console which now contains traces of the requests. 

====
From the services menu select the *travels-vm.travel-agency* and click *Find Traces*. By default you will receive the last _20 Traces_ captured in the _last hour_ but you can increase that to up to _1500 Traces_ as well as configure the time these were captured at from the menu. 
====

The console displays a top-level overview of:

* the requests in/out of the Virtual Machine (each _dot_ in the graph and each *Trace* line entry below represent a request passing through the *travels-vm.travel-agency*)
* showing both successful and failed traced requests (a _blue dot_ indicates successful requests, a _red dot_ failed ones)
* the services the request traverses, (The *Trace* line entry identifies the services this request has traversed, spans created and total request time)
* overall time of the trace.

====
*Click* now on one *Trace line*, it will give you additional information on each individual step (span):

* success or failure HTTP code (HTTP 200 vs HTTP 500),
* the time elapsed.

The animated icon showcases reviewing successful and failed requests.

image::09-t2-jaeger-tracing.gif[link=self, window=blank]
====

### 3. Grafana Dashboard

====
Finally, go back to the `Grafana dashboard`.

The _Istio Mesh Dashboard_ now has been populated with information about the application that you can use to undertand the healthiness, content and usage of the solution.

image::10-t2-grafana-mesh-dashboard-with-data.png[Istio Mesh Dashboard]
====

NOTE: *Congratulations for making it through all the steps!!!* That was a lot of information and they are at the operator's fingertips with one simple annotation insertion.

## Task 4: Validate that the _Travel Booking_ application is working correctly

In the final step, *test if the _Travel Booking_* application is operational. 

====
Access the _Travel Business_ dashboard https://travel-dashboard-travel-control.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[window=_blank].
====

*Challenge: Why is the dashboard not accessible?*

TIP: You have to https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/service_mesh/index#ossm-routing-ingress_traffic-management[configure the mesh to expose services to the outside, window=_blank]. We will perform this in the next module.

Since, the user interface is not accessible yet, we will test the solution through internal service-to-service communications. We are going to simulate a booking request by sending a request for a travel quote from the `travels` portal in the `travel-portal` namespace to the `travels-vm` virtual machine in the `travel-agency` namespace:

[,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc -n travel-portal exec $(oc -n travel-portal get po -l app=travels|awk '{print $1}'|tail -n 1) -- curl -s travels-vm.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/travels/London |jq
----

You should receive a quote similar to the one following:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes]
----
{
  "city": "London",
  "coordinates": null,
  "createdAt": "2025-03-24T13:58:06Z",
  "status": "Valid",
  "flights": [
    {
      "airline": "Red Airlines",
      "price": 1018
    },
    {
      "airline": "Blue Airlines",
      "price": 368
    },
    {
      "airline": "Green Airlines",
      "price": 318
    }
  ],
  "hotels": [
    {
      "hotel": "Grand Hotel London",
      "price": 590
    },
    {
      "hotel": "Little London Hotel",
      "price": 116
    }
  ],
  "cars": [
    {
      "carModel": "Sports Car",
      "price": 1090
    },
    {
      "carModel": "Economy Car",
      "price": 336
    }
  ],
  "insurances": [
    {
      "company": "Yellow Insurances",
      "price": 325
    },
    {
      "company": "Blue Insurances",
      "price": 74
    }
  ]
}
----

## Task 5 (Optional): Explore Additional Kiali Features

Go back to the `Kiali` Dashboard.

NOTE: `Kiali` also has a *Replay* feature, and you can find the replay icon image:07-t2-kiali-replay.png[] next to the *Last 1 minute* link. Explore this additional capability to look at the state of the network at an earlier time, selecting different options.

You can go beyond the basic visualization to explore the default _security_ configurations the mesh has already applied. 

====
Click on *Graph* and select *Display -> Security* in the drop down menu. This reveals through the *lock icon* that all communications have now been encrypted via a mesh generated and rotated TLS certificate. 
====

====
Click on the line connecting the *travels v1* service to *travels vm* and notice on the right hand-side menu under *mTLS Enabled*, it shows the principals in the _spiffe_ certificates exchanged. 
====

NOTE: *Just like that* we have ensured no man in the middle loophole!!

But, that is not all: 

====
The *Display* menu gives you the ability to visualise the *% of Traffic Distribution*, *Throughput request/response*, *Response Time (by percentile)*. Go ahead and use these options to explore the information as the following animated guide also shows.

image::07-t2-kiali-graph-validation.gif[link=self, window=blank]
====

The mesh is by default also capturing network metrics of the workloads (including the VMs). 
You can use it to check more details on the _throughput size_ and _latency_ in/out of the *travels-vm* Virtual Machine. 

====
Go to *Workloads -> travels-vm -> Inbound Metrics*, and increase the time metrics from the top right drop-down menu from the default *Last 1 minute* to *1 hour*. 
====

====
You can also select from the *Reported from* drop down *Source* (to see the metrics reported on the source service) and tick the *Tredline* option. 
====

====
You are now able to hover and explore per service in the `travel-agency` namespace the throughput and duration of requests towards *travels-vm*. 
====

====
Now changing to the *Outbound Metrics* tab, you can perform the same review for the services called by *travels vm* (the animated guide below shows the pages retrieved through these actions). The *Tredline* will help to understand if things are going up or down.

image::08-t2-kiali-metrics.gif[link=self, window=blank]
====

Finally, as we said earlier, `Kiali` enables the operator to also manage mesh configurations. 

====
Go to *Istio Config -> Namespace (drop down) -> Select all travel-xxx namespaces*. 

You should see that there are no custom added configurations as we have not yet started to configure the mesh with additional _authorization_, _traffic_ or _resillience_ mesh configurations. 
====

====
Select instead *Istio Config -> Namespace (drop down) -> istio-system* and now you will see the default configurations added by the mesh. 

The *default* https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/destination-rule/[`DestinationRule`,window=_blank], as also shown by the animated icon below, enforces *ISTIO_MUTUAL TLS* policy to all destinations with a suffix of `$$*$$.cluster.local` in service name and this includes all the services you created in *_Module 1_*. 

image::07-t2-kiali-configs.gif[link=self, window=blank]
====

We do explore https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/destination-rule/[`DestinationRule`,window=_blank](s) and additional mesh configurations more extensively in the next module.

NOTE: Take a moment to pause and reflect on what has happened! The change of annotating the `VirtualMachine` resource with `sidecar.istio.io/inject` has achieved all this. The Virtual Machines did not get altered but you are already getting a whole new experience. 

## Congratulations

In this module you have introduced the _Travel Booking_ namespaces, containers and Virtual Machines to service mesh, reviewed all the observability tooling on offer from OpenShift Service Mesh and by now have an understanding of how sidecars configure cross-cutting features of security, traffic and monitoring without altering the internal application components whether these are VMs or containers. The ease with which mesh has offered this is the most appealing aspect of all.
