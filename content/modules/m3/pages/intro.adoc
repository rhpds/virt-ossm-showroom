# Module 3: Enhancing Networking & Observability with OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM)

In this module we are going to explore added features of OpenShift, through the OpenShift Service Mesh add-on service, to elevate the experience of operating and monitoring Virtual Machines as first class citizens in a cloud native world.  


## Objectives

* Integrate Virtual Machines with OpenShift Service Mesh for advanced networking
* Implement traffic management and review observability features


## About OpenShift Service Mesh

OpenShift https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/microservices/what-is-a-service-mesh[Service Mesh] is an add-on service layer aimed at providing features to enhance the platform capabilities in 4 main use cases for Cloud Native applications:

. Security
. Traffic Management
. Observability
. Resilliene & Error Handling

OpenShift Service Mesh, delivered as part of the platform, adds the above cross-cutting application capabilities through the following components:

* *istiod*: applies all defined policies (encryption, authorization, traffic management, observability) in the network of Virtual Machines and containers included in the mesh.
* *envoy*: a sidecar container, of a Virtual Machines or container, with the ability to receive and apply the policies effectively makeing a Virtual Machine part of the mesh. The envoy sits side-by-side to a Virtual Machine (see the image above) and intercepts all requests coming in and out of it.
* *Kiali*: visualises through a UI what is configured in the mesh, the network of included applications, the traffic throughut/latency, the security utilised, the issues that may occur in the configurations or netwrork, the logs and a host of other features that the mesh offers.
* The rest of the observbility components (as seen in the image above) contain parts of what `kiali` visualises for a deeper inspection 
** `Prometheus` collects the _metrics_ emitted by the `envoy` of each container/VM in the mesh, 
** `Jaeger` collects _traces_ of each container/VM in the mesh and draws a path (`span`) of microservices a request traversed showing the time the request spent in each microservice and success/failure state, 
** `Grafana` provides additional dashboards for the operators and business analysts to review on performance, request throughput/latency, success/failures etc.
* *Gateways*: one or more `ingress gateway` instances support traffic flow into service mesh from the outside. This is required since the mesh comes with `network policies` that disable direct access to VMs/containers in the mesh. Also an `egress gateway` respectively can control outgoing traffic from the mesh to external services.

NOTE: The administrators have already done the setup of Service Mesh so lets see how easy it is to enable a a Virtual Machine to take advantage of these new capabilities.
