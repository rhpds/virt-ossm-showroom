# Module 3: Integrating and Observing Virtual Machines in OpenShift Service Mesh

## Congratulations on completing this module!

In this module you have introduced the _Travel Booking_ namespaces, containers and VMs to service mesh, reviewed all the observability tooling on offer from OpenShift Service Mesh and by now have an understanding of how sidecars configure cross-cutting features of security, traffic and monitoring without altering the internal application components whether these are VMs or containers. 

The ease with which a VM can be enhanced with features of cross-cutting concern (security, observability) in a cloud native world is the most appealing aspect of all.


In the next scenario you will be going further by configuring resillience, fault-tolerance and automation of deploying and managing multiple versions of your VMs.

Continue now to Module 4 - _Enhancing Traffic Resilience and Security for Virtual Machines with OpenShift Service Mesh_
