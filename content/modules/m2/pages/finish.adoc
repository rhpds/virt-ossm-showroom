# Module 2 - Scaling Virtual Machines on OpenShift

## Congratulations on completing this module!

In this module you have deployed the business dashboard (aka `control-vm`), exposed it to the cluster outside and explored some of the scaling capabilities with OpenShift Virtualization.
In the next module we are going to introduce OpenShift Service Mesh and using it in the context of Virtual Machines.

Continue now to Module 3 - _Enhancing Networking & Observability with OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM)_
