## Module 2 - Scaling Virtual Machines on OpenShift

In this module we are going to finish setting up the Travel Application demo.
And we are exploring the scaling options for Virtual Machines in OpenShift.

## Objectives

* Complete the Travel Application Demo
* Scaling up Virtual Machines
* Scaling out Virtual Machines

## About Scaling of Virtual Machines

OpenShift Virtualization extends Kubernetes by allowing it to manage virtual machines (VMs) alongside containers. Scaling with OpenShift Virtualization can be approached in two ways:

### Scaling Up (Vertical Scaling)

Scaling up involves increasing the resources (CPU, memory, storage) allocated to a VM. 
This is useful when a single VM requires more power instead of distributing the workload across multiple instances.

You can modify VM Resources by editing a VirtualMachine (VM) specification to increase CPU and memory resources.

### Scaling Out (Horizontal Scaling)

Scaling out means adding more VM instances to distribute the workload. 
This is useful for workloads that need high availability or load balancing.

We can use a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) Alternative: Since Kubernetes HPA is designed for pods, we can use KubeVirt VirtualMachineInstances (VMI) ReplicaSets.
