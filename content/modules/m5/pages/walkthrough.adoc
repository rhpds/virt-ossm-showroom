# Declarative Management of VMs with OpenShift GitOps

NOTE: All assets for this module are in the folder `lab-5`. Please change the directory into this folder.

[,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cd $HOME/virt-ossm-workspace/lab-5
----

In this module we want to deploy everything declaratively and let it be managed by OpenShift GitOps. 

NOTE: You'll notice that three parts of the application, the `travel-portal` and `travel-agency` as well as the `service mesh` components are already managed by OpenShift GitOps.

We will be using a `helm-chart` to provide the Kubernetes and service mesh manifests for the missing `travel-control` domain.
But first, let's explore what is already managed by OpenShift GitOps.

## Task 1: Explore the ArgoCD Dashboard and the existing Argo applications

====
First, we are going to open the OpenShift GitOps Dashboard.

In the OpenShift Web Console, click at the top on the _applications_ icon and select `Cluster Argo CD`

====

====
Click on `LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT` and use your admin credentials: {openshift_cluster_admin_username} / {openshift_cluster_admin_password}

image::argo-login-oauth.png[link="self",window=_blank]
====

====
Welcome to the Argo Dashboard.

You see 4 Argo applications running and being managed by OpenShift GitOps. (You can ignore the `bootstrap` application)

An *Argo CD application* is a Kubernetes resource that defines and manages the deployment of workloads based on a Git repository. It continuously syncs the desired application state from Git to the cluster, ensuring consistency and enabling automated rollbacks if deviations occur.

You also notice the Sync status and the Health for each application:

*Sync status* - Whether or not the live state matches the target state. Is the deployed application the same as Git says it should be?

*Health* - The health of the application, is it running correctly? Can it serve requests?

Now click on the `travel-agency` application.
====

====
You now see a visual representation of the Kubernetes resources that are deployed as part of this argo application.

image::argo-travel-agency.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Now click i.e. on the `virt-launcher-cars-vm...` pod to look at the details of this component.
====

====
You'll get an overview with the details and the state of this pod. You can also explore the deployed `LIVE MANIFEST` of this component.

image::argo-carsvm-detail.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Now click on the `LOGS` tab.
====

====
You see the logs of the running containers inside
 this pod. You can switch between the containers by selecting them from the shown dropdown menu.

image::argo-container-logs.png[link="self",window=_blank]

Close this window which brings you back to the overview. 
====

====
Back in the overview click on `DETAILS` at the top.

This gives you an overview of the configuration for this argo application, like the source git repository, the target cluster, status and health, as well as the configured  

Sync Policy:

* *Automated Sync* – Automatically applies changes from Git to the cluster when updates are detected, without manual intervention.
* *Prune Resources* – Deletes resources from the cluster if they are removed from the Git repository, preventing orphaned resources.
* *Self-Heal* – Continuously monitors and corrects drift by reverting manual changes in the cluster to match the desired state from Git.

Close the window and click on `Applications` in the left menu of the Argo Dashboard.
====

## Task 2: Create an Argo application for travel-control

Imagine a DevOps engineer accidentally deletes the `travel-control` namespace that contains critical applications for the _Travel Agency_ company. Without Argo CD, this would require manual intervention to restore the namespace and redeploy the applications, leading to downtime.

Exactly, what we do right now!

[,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc delete project travel-control
----

IMPORTANT: With Argo CD and Self-Heal enabled, the system would detect the deletion and automatically recreates the namespace and all its resources from the Git repository. This ensures minimal disruption and maintains the desired state without manual effort.

This makes Argo CD a great fit for teams that need automated recovery, drift correction, and continuous deployment in OpenShift.

Now let us create an argo app for the `travel-control` component.

====
After logging in, click the `+ New App` button as shown below:

image::wt-argo-new-app.png[link="self",window=_blank]
====

====
Give your app the name `travel-control`, use the argo project `default`, and leave the sync policy as `Manual`:

image::wt-01.png[link="self",window=_blank]
====

====
Connect the `https://github.com/rhpds/virt-ossm-workspace` repo to Argo CD by setting repository url to the github repo url, leave revision as `HEAD`, and set the path to `lab-5/travel-control`:

NOTE: We have already provided all necessary Kubernetes manifests in this `repository` and `path`. Feel free to explore this Helm Chart if you like. 

image::wt-02.png[link="self",window=_blank]
====

====
For Destination, set cluster URL to https://kubernetes.default.svc (or in-cluster for cluster name) and leave the namespace empty:

image::wt-03.png[link="self",window=_blank]
====

====
In the Helm section, provide the URL of the Service Mesh ingress gateway by overwriting the `ossm_ingress` parameter:

[,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}
----

image::wt-05.png[link="self",window=_blank]
====

====
After filling out the information above, click Create at the top of the UI to create the `travel-control` application:

image::wt-04.png[300,link="self",window=_blank]
====

====
Once the `travel-control` argo application is created, you can now view its status:

image::wt-06.png[link="self",window=_blank]

The application status is initially in OutOfSync state since the application has yet to be deployed, and no Kubernetes resources have been created.
====

====
To sync (deploy) the application:

On the Applications page, click on `SYNC` button of the `travel-control` application. 
A panel will be opened and then, click on `SYNCHRONIZE` button.

image::wt-07.png[link="self",window=_blank]
====

====
By clicking on the `travel-control` application you open the details of the app, and you'll see which resources have been applied, as well as the Sync status, last sync and application health.

Wait for a few minutes until everything is up and running.

image::wt-08.png[link="self",window=_blank]
====

====
In the last step we test if the whole solution is working correctly, by opening the *Business Dashboard* of the _Booking Application_ again.

## Task 3: Validate Argo CD Self-Healing

To test Argo CD’s **self-healing capability**, you can manually delete a Kubernetes resource managed by Argo CD. With **Automated Sync** and **Self-Heal** enabled, Argo CD will detect the drift from the desired Git state and automatically **recreate the deleted resource**, confirming that self-healing is working as expected.

====
First, we need to enable `Auto-Sync` and `Self-Healing` for the travel-control application.

Click on `DETAILS`, and in the details window scroll down and click on `ENABLE AUTO-SYNC`.

image::travel-control-detail.png[link="self",window=_blank]
====

====
Now click on `ENABLE` for the `Self Heal` sync option.

image::sync-policy.png[link="self",window=_blank]

And that is it!
====

Now we are going to delete all content from the `travel-control` namespace. Execute the following command in the terminal on your right hand side:

[,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc delete AuthorizationPolicy,DestinationRule,Route,Service,smm,VirtualMachine,VirtualService -l module=m5 -n travel-control
----

====
The Argo CD dashboard will briefly show:

1. **Application status as "OutOfSync"** – indicating that the live cluster state no longer matches the Git source.
2. The deleted resource will **disappear from the resource tree** temporarily.
3. Within moments, Argo CD will **auto-sync**, and the deleted resource will **reappear**, restoring the desired state.
4. The status will return to **"Synced" and "Healthy"**, confirming self-healing has taken place.

*Congratulations!!* You helped the _Travel Agency_ company to operate their whole solution now through GitOps.
