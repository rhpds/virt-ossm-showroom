## Lab instructions and commands

Here is an overview of the different types of instructions you'll find throughout the lab. 

[source,shell,subs=attributes,role=execute]
----
echo 'This is a shell command you should execute in the terminal. 
You can copy the command with the icon on the right'
----

[source,shell,subs=attributes]
----
echo 'This is a shell command or shell output. 
But nothing you need to execute.'
----

This is an example instruction using your web browser or OpenShift Web Console.
Just follow the instructions in this box.

## Lab assets

//Before you begin, access your link:https://codeserver-codeserver-{openshift_cluster_user_name}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[code-server environment,window=_blank] and ensure you have access to the lab assets `ossm-labs`.

// Open a terminal (*`Terminal`* -> *`New Terminal`* from the menu) in the _code-server_ so that you can execute the commands during the labs.

You have a terminal on your right hand side and we have provided you with a repo of assets (scripts) to be used throughout the lab.

Please clone the repository as shown below:

[source,shell,subs=attributes,role=execute]
----
git clone {virt_ossm_workspace_repo}/{virt_ossm_workspace_project}
----

List your cloned directory and see if all the assets are available:

[source,shell,subs=attributes,role=execute]
----
ls -la {virt_ossm_workspace_project}
----

You can go and inspect these resources in this repository at a later stage.

//Although for the labs the assets are made available you can additionally get and inspect these resources at a later stage from the link:https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/ossm-labs[ossm-labs,window=_blank] github repository.

## Openshift Cluster Environment

[IMPORTANT]
====
You will be using a *dedicated OpenShift cluster with OpenShift Virtualization, OpenShift Service Mesh and other components already installed*. In this lab you are going to explore and leverage these services, but not install them.
