# Module 4: Enhancing Traffic Resilience and Security for Virtual Machines with OpenShift Service Mesh

## Congratulations on completing this module!


You have come a long way to create a more secure and robust solution for the _Travel Agency_ company. 

You have explored VMs in OpenShift, used Service Mesh for Observability, traffic management, canary rollouts and security enhancements and also scaled virtual machines. 

IMPORTANT: All of this has been achieved without modifying anything inside the VMs!

In the next scenario you will be automating the delivery of these configurations so that they can be monitored and applied as your needs change in a declarative rather than imperative manner by using _OpenShift GitOps_.

Continue now to Module 5 - _Declarative Management of VMs with OpenShift GitOps_
