# Module 4: Resilience, Scalability and Fault Aversion for VMs in a Cloud Native manner

In this module we are going to explore how you can further make the solution secure and robust whilst exposing it to the outside world. You will ensure that your Virtual Machine based solution can recover from failures of a VM without having to managet that yourself and releasing new version of your components.


## Objectives

* Expose Virtual Machines for public consumption via Service Mesh ingress gateway.
* Perform a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle#Canary_release[canary release deployment] of a new version on one of the Virtual Machines, run it in parallel to the original and define % of traffic to flow on each version.
* Create policies with the help of Service Mesh to exclude instances of your Virtual Machines when they are unresponsive in order to ensure any failures do not impact end-user requests.
* Apply restrictions for business and security purposes via authorization policies.


## About cloud native capabilities

### Canary Release

In traditional monolithic applications new features where released with a feature toggle which when enabled it would allow a subset of requests to flow through the new feature functionality. In a cloud native world where microservices contain the subset of the functionality the toggle can be the version associated with the a microservice deployment.

`Canary release` (or canary launch or canary deployment) allows for the release of a new feature microservice targeted by a flag, the URI of changed version or other means available to differentiate between the instance of old and new feature.

### Circuit Breakers

 will perform the following actions taking advantage of both OpensShift and Service Mesh capabilities
