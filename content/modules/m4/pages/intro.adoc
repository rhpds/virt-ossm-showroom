# Module 4: Integrating VMs with OpenShift Service Mesh for Security, Ressilience, New Flows

## ABOUT THIS LAB

In this lab scenario you will explore how you can further make the solution secure and robust whilst accessible to the outside world into your VMs is readmitted. You will be ensuring that your VM based solution can recover from failures of a VM without having to managet that yourself and releasing new version of your components.


## Objectives

* Expose Virtual Machines for public consumption via Service Mesh ingress gateway.
* Release a new version of a Virtual Machine, run it in parallel to the original and define % of traffic to flow to each.
* Create policies with the help of Service Mesh to exclude instances of your Virtual Machines when they are unresponsive in order to ensure any failures do not impact end-user requests.
* Apply restrictions for business and security purposes via authorization policies.
