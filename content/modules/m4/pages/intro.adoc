# Module 4: Integrating VMs with OpenShift Service Mesh for Security, Ressilience, New Flows

## ABOUT THIS LAB

In this lab scenario you will explore how you can enable access to the outside worls into your VMs, ensuring that your VM based solution can recover the failure of a VM without having to managet that yourself and releasing new version of your components..  


## Objectives

* Allow traffic to flow in via ServiceMesh (Gateway/VirtualService for Control VM) - gw ingress configuration
* Define VirtualServices and DestinationRules for traffic routing/weights etc. to the scaled out VM in SM
* Enable mutual TLS for VM-to-container communication
* Authz policies (apply denyall and then allow specific)  (from this)
* Define Istio DestinationRules for retries and timeouts
* Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
